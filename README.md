Hi. I'm not so sure what I'm doing here but sometimes it's fun so I keep doing uh... Whatever it is that I'm doing at the moment.

I have learned HTML, CSS and JS/TS, Java, C++, C# and VB6 (but I'd rather not touch that again), and I have tried my hand at Rust
and assembly but didn't go very far beyond learning the core concepts. I also learned Python way back when it was still Python 2.x.

Outside of that, I am currently messing around in Godot with a mix of C# and GDScript. After coding for a while with the engine, I
noticed that GDScript allows me to write faster with no discernible impact on performance. Except for the code that does take a
hit, and that ends up getting written in C#. C#-GDScript interop in Godot is fortunately very easy, thanks to its non-existant setup
and trivial loading of scripts from both sides.

Not totally related to programming, but I also learned some LateX and know pretty much everything there is to know about Markdown.

If I'm not programming, I'm either making music or playing video games.

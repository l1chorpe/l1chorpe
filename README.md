Hi. I'm not so sure what I'm doing here but sometimes it's fun so I keep doing uh... Whatever it is that I'm doing at the moment.

I have learned HTML, CSS and JS (although I'm probably a bit rusty now), Java, C++ and VB6 (which sucks, so don't talk to me about it), and I have tried
my hand at Rust, C# and assembly, but I didn't go very far beyond learning the core concepts. Except for assembly: I learned almost nothing (which is
definitely surprising). I also learned Python way back when it was still Python 2.x so I can't really code well in it (not that I like the language
anyway).

Not totally related to programming, but I also learned some LateX and know pretty much everything there is to know about Markdown.

If I'm not programming, I'm either playing my guitar or playing video games.

Yeah, that's about it.

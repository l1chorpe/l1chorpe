Hi. I'm not so sure what I'm doing here but sometimes it's fun so I keep doing uh... Whatever it is that I'm doing at the moment.

I have learned HTML, CSS and JS/TS, Java, C++, C# and VB6 (but I'd rather not touch that again), and I have tried my hand at Rust
and assembly but didn't go very far beyond learning the core concepts. I also learned Python way back when it was still Python 2.x.

Outside of that, I am currently learning to use Godot with C#.

Not totally related to programming, but I also learned some LateX and know pretty much everything there is to know about Markdown.

If I'm not programming, I'm either making music or playing video games.
